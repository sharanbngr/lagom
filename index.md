### __About Me__

I am a doctoral candidate in physics at the University of Minnesota with Prof. Vuk Mandic. I study
gravitational-waves and their detection with ground-based and space-borne gravitational-wave detectors.
I am a member of the LIGO scientific collaboration and the LISA consortium. My research focuses on 
detection and characterization of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds and transient gravitational-waves.  

  
### __Research Interests__

I am broadly interested in gravitational-wave physics and data analysis methods extracting astrophysical and
cosmological information from them. I am also particularly interested in studying binary neutron star merger
remnants and have been involved in both gravitational-wave searches for these remnants and in development of
statistical techniques to find and characterize them. Some of these techniques are also useful for searches
targeting unmodeled or poorly modeled gravitational-wave sources. 

On the other end of the spectrum, I also work on methods and techniques for detecting stochastic gravitational-wave
backgrounds. These backgrounds can come from a variety of sources - with perhaps the most anticipated one being a 
hypothetical cosmological inflationary background. But from the point of view of LIGO detectors, a background from
binary black-hole and binary neutron star mergers is the most important one. This background is just the net sum of
all those events which are not individually. 

Since my research mostly focuses on analysis of data, I am also interested in statistical methods - especially bayesian
methods - and their applications to astrophysical problems.
