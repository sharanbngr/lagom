## About Me

 I am a doctoral candidate in physics at the University of Minnesota with Prof. Vuk Mandic. I study gravitational-waves and their detection with ground-based and space-borne gravitational-wave detectors. I am a member of the LIGO collobaration and the LISA consortium. My research focuses on detection and characterization of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds and transient gravitational-waves.
